			The Admiral Pub is a cosy little bar on the top of the hill in West Seattle, The food is good and the prices are reasonable. They have pool tables and dartsâ€¦ well just watch the commercial. This was my first very first commercial, shot on DSR400 and a DVX200 then edited in FinalCut. I directed, produce, wrote, and catered, basically this was a one man show using real customers as the people in the commercial, and it suuucked, no help really sucks. However it was a great learning experience and it come out pretty good.
