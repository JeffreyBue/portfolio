			Spiritualdirt.com is my first ever Node.js / Express app. It was an idea I had when I was thinking about winning the lottery, I was looking at the beach and wondered how many grains a sands there were, and if I were to sell enough grains a sand, each for a fraction of a cent, I wouldnâ€™t have to win the lottery. Also it was a great excuse to get experience on node.js
