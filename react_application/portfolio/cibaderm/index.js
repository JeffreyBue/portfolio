			Very similar to Cibdex.com this is a lifestyle web site for people wanting to enhance their wellbeing with the supplement ^CBD. We used the wordpress theme Hotec and shaped the look and feel to complement the vision of this product. It’s a great site that brings in quite a bit of cash, also it’s really a decent body product that is super popular. The salve alone takes in thousands of dollars a month
